# Idaho's gender equality in NCAA observatory
In this repository we have a script *app.R* used for creating a shiny web application that checks Idaho's gender equality in college sports and a script for data checking and analysis, *app_prep.R*

In more depth, the app uses a dataset from #tidyTuesday and allows users to interactively check how different universities from different cities in the state of Idaho rate in terms of gender equality in sports. Users can compare different universities sports' programs in terms of revenue per athlete, expense per athlete and total participation in the program. In a second panel, the user can see a summary of the different sports programs do in a state of Idaho perspective, and how they evolved through time in terms of participation and investment per athlete.
